# Neural-Network

## Introduction

As shown in the following figure, a natural neuron is composed of a nucleus, dendrites and axon. The axon extends itself into several branches to form synapses with other neurons dendrities.

So, the artificial neuron has a similar structure. It contains a nucleus (processing unit), several dendrities (analogous to inputs), and one axon (analogous to output), as shown in the following figure:

## Architecture

We define the artifical neuron structure as shown in the following figure:

- Inputs
- Output
- Weights
- Bias
- Activation Function

There are two modalities of architectures for neural networks:

- Neuron connections
  - Monolayer networks
  - Multilayer networks

- Signal flow
  - Feedforward networks
  - Feedback networks
